    THROWING IDEAS AT THE WALL:

        JS:
        IT MAY NOT BE MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE THING TO HAVE EVER LEARNED (AND KEEP LEARNING), BUT IT'S NECCESSARY AND I'LL CODE WITH IT UNTIL I LEARN TO LOVE IT

        CSS:
        I LOVE CSS FOR THE INSTANT GRATIFICATION OF SEEING WHAT I WANT BROUGHT TO LIFE ON THE PAGE AND YOU KNOW IF THAT'S WHAT I WANT RIGHT AWAY

        HTML:
        AH, THE BASICS AND FOUNDATION OF WHAT I LOVE TO DO.  BE SPECTACULAR AT THE BASICS AND THE REST WILL FOLLOW

        GIT:
        VERSION CONTROL. *SIGH*

        MATERIALIZE AND BOOTSTRAP:
        QUICKER THAN CODING IT ALL YOURSELF (...WHICH I COULD, BUT WHY RE-INVENT THE WHEEL?)  LET'S MAKE STUFF FASTER!  

        BACK-END:
        I'VE BUILT TWO DIFFERENT LOG-IN AUTHENTICATIONS.  ITS CHALLENGING TO CODE AND NOT "SEE" WHAT YOU ARE MAKING,BUT I ENJOYED SEEING IT FALL INTO PLACE AND LINKING THAT FUNCTIONALITY TO THE FONT-END AND HAVING IT ALL COME TOGETHER
